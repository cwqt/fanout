# Webhooks &nbsp;<a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/project/core-314910/overview"><img alt="Firebase" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/firebase-%23039BE5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=firebase"/></a>


Fan-out webhooks to feature deployed branches - since we can't make webhooks on-the-fly for endpoints.
See <https://github.com/muxinc/mux-node-sdk/issues/12>

Makes no attempt to re-try requests, if a down-stream site fails, then tough luck.

```
                      +---------------+  Register/destroy the domain
mux.com  stripe.com   | Github Action |  POST   /endpoints?url=...&api_key=...
  |         |         +---------------+  DELETE /endpoints?url=...&api_key=...
  |         |               |
  v         v               v
+----------------------------------+      /-----------\

+----------------------------------+      \-----------/
        |       |       |               Look-up where to fan
        v       v       v               out webhooks to
    su-345  su-145  su-778.stageup.uk
```
